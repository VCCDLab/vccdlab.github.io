I am an associate professor in University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). I got my PhD degree and B.S degree from USTC, respectively in 2006 and 2001. Since 2006, I have been working in School of Information Science and Technoloyg, USTC. In 2011.3-2011.11, I was nominated to join the “STARTRACKER” project of Microsoft Research of Asia (MSRA), and worked on sparse representation & object recognition in visual computing group as a vendor researcher (host by [Prof. Yi Ma](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yima/)). During 2012.2-2013.2, I was a visiting research scholar of EECS Department in University of California at Berkeley (host by Prof. S.Shankar Sastry), and worked on object recognition in the Trust & Chess Center with [Prof. S.Shankar Sastry](http://robotics.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sastry/) and [Dr. Allen Y.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
